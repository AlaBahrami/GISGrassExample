# GISGrassExample
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to generate geospatial parameters using the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS. The programs have been written so that users can produce the geospatial parameters on their local machine or launch programs on the Digital Research Alliance clusters, such as Graham. 

For the test case, the GRASS GIS is used to produce the global spatially variable terrain slope required for the Canadian Land Surface Scheme Including Biogeochemical Cycles(CLASSIC) model.
